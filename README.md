### Data source
The primary dataset ues for this analysis is the " Abuja-Kaduna Train Attack manifest.csv" file, containing detailed information about the incident

### Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop, for data  cleaning and creating Report
- DAX for calculated measures 
- Excel in CSV format as the data source

  ### Data cleaning/ Preparation
  In the initial data preparation we performed the following tasks:
  1. Data loading into power query.
  2. Handling missing values.
  3. Removing Duplicates
  4. Renaming of columns

### Exploratotry Data Analysis 
EDA involve exploring the data to answer the key questions such as
1. what is the total revenue generated from ticket sales?
2. what is the passenger status distribution ?
3. which payment platforms are frequently used by passengers?
4. how does coach occupancy and seat utilisation during the attack correlate with the casualty ?
   
### Result / findings
- **Total Revenue** 
- **Status Distribution**
- **Payment Platforms** 
- **Coach Occupancy**
